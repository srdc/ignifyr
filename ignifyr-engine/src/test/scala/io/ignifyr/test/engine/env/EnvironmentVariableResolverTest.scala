/**
 * Covers `${ENV_VAR}` substitution in mapping-job definitions. Only the names listed in the
 * `EnvironmentVariable` enumeration are substitutable; anything else is rejected rather than silently
 * left in place, which is what makes a typo in a job file a startup error instead of a bad FHIR write.
 *
 * `resolveFileContent` is exercised against an explicit environment (`sys.env` cannot be set from
 * inside the JVM); the object-level paths need no environment because they are the failure paths.
